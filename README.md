###PixShare-SSN
<p>
PixShare-SSN is a web application designed for students to share and cherish 
their beautiful memories of college life. With PixShare-SSN, users can connect with friends, 
post pictures, like posts, and enjoy a seamless experience with dark mode and light mode themes. 
The project is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, providing a robust 
and modern foundation for the application.</p>

<p>
Technologies Used:
<p/>
<p>
MongoDB: Database management system for storing user data and posts.
<p/>
<p>
Express.js: Web application framework for building the server-side API.
<p/>
<p>
React: JavaScript library for building the user interface and front-end components.
<p/>
<p>
Node.js: Runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
<p/>
<p>
Netlify: Hosting platform for deploying and serving the PixShare-SSN project.
<p/>
<p>
Running the Application
<p/>
<p>
To run the PixShare-SSN project, you need to set up and run both the server-side (Node.js) and client-side (React) components. Follow the instructions below to get started:
<p/>

Server-Side (Node.js):

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.


1.Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

```console
cd 'path to melthify app'
```


2.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```console
cd server
npm i
```

Configure the MongoDB connection by providing your database credentials in the .env file.

Start the server by running the following command:

##To start the server : 
```console
npm start
```
The server will start running, and you should see a message indicating the server is listening on a specific port (e.g., Port 5000).

Client-Side (React):

1.Open a new terminal and navigate to the project's client directory.

```console
cd 'path to app'
```

2.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:


```console
cd client
npm i
```

Start the React development server by running the following command:

```console
npm run dev
```

The React development server will start running, and the PixShare-SSN application will open in your default web browser.

Note
Make sure you have a MongoDB database set up and provide the correct database credentials in the .env file before running the server-side component. Additionally, ensure that the specified ports for the server and React development server are available and not used by any other applications.

Feel free to explore and enhance the PixShare-SSN project to make it even more delightful for students to share their college memories!

Happy sharing and reminiscing the wonderful moments of college life!
